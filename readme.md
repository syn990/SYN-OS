# SYN-OS

![SYN-OS Banner](./Images/SYN-BANNER.png)

**SYN-OS** is a highly customizable Arch Linux‚Äìbased operating system crafted by **William Hayward-Holland** (*Syntax990*).  
It combines Arch‚Äôs minimal base with curated build scripts, dotfiles, and custom theming to deliver a streamlined, efficient, and personalized environment.

SYN-OS is designed for those who want:
- **Full control** over packages, themes, and configurations.
- **Terminal-first efficiency** with optional GUI via Openbox.
- **A ready-to-use base** that‚Äôs still true to Arch principles.

> **Note:** The live installer runs entirely in a command-line (CLI) environment. You can install SYN-OS on real hardware or test it first in a virtual machine (VirtualBox, VMware, QEMU, etc.) before committing. Once installed, you can launch the graphical desktop with `startx`, which opens a lightweight **Openbox** session with a **Polybar** panel across the top. Polybar uses simple ini-style configuration, making it easy to adjust modules, colours and layout without touching XML.

## üí° Philosophy

SYN-OS is not just ‚ÄúArch with a desktop preinstalled.‚Äù You could do that in an afternoon, but you‚Äôd miss the entire point ‚Äî the insight, control, and hands-on wiring that comes from building your environment piece by piece.

Think of it like the alien tech in *District 9* ‚Äî parts scavenged, rewired, and assembled into something uniquely functional. Every script, array, and configuration is chosen to fit together with intention, but you can rip it apart, swap components, and make it entirely your own.

Key principles:
1. **Barebones Foundation**  
   Starts as close to the metal as possible ‚Äî no excess services, no bloated DEs, no assumptions. You build from the ground up.

2. **Modular by Design**  
   Everything is organized into logical arrays and overlay directories. Want to swap a window manager, remove a service, or change the panel? It‚Äôs a matter of editing a few lines, not unpicking tangled dependencies.

3. **Transparency**  
   All installation logic is in plain, readable shell scripts. You see *every* command that touches your system.

4. **Terminal-First Workflow**  
   SYN-OS boots to TTY for speed and control. The GUI is there when you want it, but never in the way.

5. **User Empowerment**  
   You don‚Äôt just get an OS ‚Äî you learn *why* it‚Äôs set up the way it is, and how to change it. The system never hides its wiring.

6. **Creative Freedom**  
   The included Openbox + Polybar environment is just a starter kit ‚Äî a functional skeleton. From there, you can morph it into a minimal command centre or layer on full desktop environments without losing the modular backbone.

## üõ† Building Your Own ISO

SYN-OS is built using **ArchISO**, the official Arch Linux live environment creation tool. At its core, SYN-OS is simply an **ArchISO profile** ‚Äî a collection of package lists, configurations, and overlays that tell ArchISO how to assemble the final image.

If you:
- Test and adjust the install scripts,
- Remove or replace packages in the profile arrays,
- Update `/root/syn-resources/DotFileOverlay` and `/etc/skel` with your own configurations,

‚Ä¶then run the included build script:

    ./BUILD-SYNOS-ISO.zsh

You can produce a completely fresh ISO image ‚Äî your own operating system ‚Äî from scratch.

If you replace every reference to ‚ÄúSYN-OS‚Äù in the scripts, boot themes, and documentation, you don‚Äôt even need to credit me. That‚Äôs the power and freedom of this design. I will never make this commercial because SYN-OS is not a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù or ‚Äúservice‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs a teaching tool. It‚Äôs about **axiomatic consciousness** and **process over product**: understanding the principles, not just consuming a pre-built environment.

---

### Why This Matters

When you build your own ISO this way, you gain something you can‚Äôt get from simply ‚Äúinstalling a DE on vanilla Arch.‚Äù You see the wiring ‚Äî the package choices, the configuration hierarchy, the build order. You‚Äôre not just putting a desktop on top of a base; you‚Äôre constructing the base itself, deciding *what exists at all* in your environment.

The value isn‚Äôt just in ‚Äúlearning Linux‚Äù or feeling clever. The real goal is that *ah-ha* moment where you see that this is **your platform**. Not mine. Not Arch‚Äôs. Not some company‚Äôs. Yours.

That insight changes how you look at every piece of software you touch. You stop thinking like a ‚Äúuser‚Äù and start thinking like a *maintainer*. You develop the muscle memory of that old-school, event-driven 90s dev style ‚Äî test something, iterate, test again, no bloat, no magic black boxes, just you and the system evolving together.

---

### What You Can Do With This

Once you‚Äôve grasped this workflow, SYN-OS becomes a springboard for *serious* projects as well as creative experimentation:

- **Bare-metal minimalism** ‚Äî a stripped system with only the tools you *actually* need.  
- **Your own distro** ‚Äî rebrand, reshape, and ship your own ArchISO-based OS.  
- **Critical systems** ‚Äî create a rock-solid base for specialized tasks like robotics, drone control, industrial monitoring, or embedded hardware interfaces.  
- **Custom POS & UX platforms** ‚Äî build point-of-sale systems, kiosks, or control dashboards where the *entire* UI/UX is yours to design from scratch.  
- **A personal server OS** ‚Äî repurpose the same modular system to run as a secure, maintainable backend.  
- **Multi-environment host** ‚Äî one system image hosting multiple custom environments for work, play, or development.  
- **A permanent escape hatch** ‚Äî build your own OS pipeline and you‚Äôll never be trapped by commercial, proprietary, or infohazard software again.  
- **A creative sandbox** ‚Äî experiment without fear. If it breaks, rebuild in minutes.

The beauty of this approach is that SYN-OS gives you the *barebones control layer*, but the personality ‚Äî the UI, the interaction model, the experience ‚Äî is entirely on you. That‚Äôs the art.

A drone controller, a music performance workstation, a touchscreen kiosk, or a hacker‚Äôs terminal ‚Äî all of these could share the exact same modular base. The difference is the *vision* you layer on top.

This isn‚Äôt just about *using* Arch ‚Äî it‚Äôs about *owning* Arch, bending it to your will, and having the confidence to know you could rebuild the same environment from nothing at any time. That‚Äôs real freedom.

And if you get it right, you‚Äôll never look at an operating system the same way again.

## Project history and installer evolution

SYN‚ÄëOS grew out of an experimental project named **SYN‚ÄëRTOS**, which used simple shell scripts to bootstrap an Arch Linux system with a custom set of packages and dotfiles.  Over time, lessons from those early installers shaped the modular architecture and user experience found in modern SYN‚ÄëOS releases.

### Release timeline

| Release | Date / version | Key focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SYN‚ÄëRTOS | V1‚ÄìV3 | Two‚Äëscript installer; manual partition variables; long package list; copied root overlay by hand. |
| SYN‚ÄëOS¬†V4 | 2023‚Äì2024 | First modular build with separate shell components; clearer directory structure; early `syn-stage0.sh` script. |
| Chronomorph | Feb¬†2024 | Initial named release; refined V4 installer; minimal GUI via Openbox and Tint2. |
| Soam‚ÄëDo‚ÄëHuawei | May¬†2024 | Incremental improvements to scripts and package selection. |
| VOLITION | Jun¬†2024 | Further refinement of build process and default theme. |
| ArchTech¬†Corp. | Jul¬†2024 | Corporate‚Äëoriented customization with additional utilities. |
| M‚Äë141 | Nov¬†2024 | Polished release ahead of the canonical edition; improved documentation. |
| SYNTEX Edition | Apr¬†2025 | Latest edition; runs under zsh; modular installer; dynamic UEFI/MBR detection; Openbox + Polybar by default. |

### How and why the installer changed

The **syn‚Äëstage0** script is at the heart of SYN‚ÄëOS‚Äôs installation process.  Its evolution reflects a shift from quick experiments toward maintainability, clarity and user safety.

| Aspect | Early `syn-stage0.sh` | Modern `syn-stage0.zsh` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interpreter | `/bin/sh` | `/bin/zsh` with better scripting features |
| Structure | Linear script with global variables | Modular functions (`syn_os_environment_prep`, `disk_processing`, `pacstrap_sync`, etc.) |
| Boot mode | Assumed GPT / UEFI only | Detects UEFI vs MBR and branches accordingly |
| Package lists | Single long string (`SYNSTALL`) | Arrays grouped by purpose (core system, services, environment, user applications, developer tools, fonts, optional extras) |
| User prompts | Hard‚Äëcoded `read -p` confirmations | ASCII art warnings, coloured output and controlled confirmation logic |
| Dotfiles & scripts | Copied `/root/SYN-OS-V4/root_overlay` and separate `syn-stage1.sh` | Copies curated dotfiles from `/root/syn-resources/DotfileOverlay` and unified stage scripts (`syn-stage0.zsh`, `syn-stage1.zsh`) |
| Error handling | Minimal checks, simple exit on failure | Centralised `check_success` function after every critical command |
| Motivation for change | Fast prototype to get a custom Arch system running | Maintainability, safety, easier customisation; make it obvious how to adjust package arrays or replace components |

### Rationale

Early scripts were written quickly to automate William Hayward-Holland‚Äôs personal installation process.  As more people expressed interest in building their own versions of SYN‚ÄëOS, the need for a cleaner and safer installer became clear.  Switching to zsh allowed the use of associative arrays and other features that simplify complex scripts.  Breaking the process into functions made it easier to test and modify one piece without disturbing the rest.  Detecting the boot environment (UEFI vs MBR) removed hard‚Äëcoded assumptions that could brick a system.  Grouping packages into arrays lets users add or remove categories (developer tools, optional extras) with a single edit instead of parsing a monolithic string.  Finally, copying dotfiles and scripts from clearly named overlay directories encourages users to personalise the system without digging through obscure paths.

These changes reflect the project‚Äôs philosophy: **teaching by example**.  A well‚Äëstructured installer shows how to assemble a distribution from ArchISO building blocks, while still leaving the door open for experimentation.  The history of `syn-stage0` captures that journey from a hobbyist script to a robust, modular tool that invites hacking and learning.
