Overview
--------

SYNTERNAL is a next-generation AI interface prebuilt into **[SYN-OS](https://github.com/syn990/SYN-OS)**. Designed to interpret natural language queries and execute complex commands autonomously, it provides an unparalleled level of control and insight into the operating system's inner workings. Whether you're a power user or a beginner, SYNTERNAL adapts to your needs.

* * * * *

Key Features
------------

-   **Autonomous AI**: Operates independently, bridging the gap between system commands and user intent.

-   **Dynamic System Querying**: Fetches live data directly from the system, ensuring real-time accuracy without pre-stored outputs.

-   **Conversational Interaction**: Communicate with SYNTERNAL using natural language for tasks like system monitoring, troubleshooting, and file management.

-   **Low-Resource Optimisation**: Designed to run efficiently on systems with limited resources (2--4 GB of RAM).

-   **Custom Command Support**: Easily extend its functionality by adding your own commands and workflows.

* * * * *

Prebuilt Integration
--------------------

SYNTERNAL is a core component of ****[SYN-OS](https://github.com/syn990/SYN-OS)**** and is not available as an optional package. It is preinstalled and automatically configured during the operating system's setup, ensuring smooth integration with the OS architecture. This allows users immediate access to SYNTERNAL without any additional installation or configuration steps. It is fully self-contained and readily available for use.

### Key Advantages of Prebuilt Integration:

-   **Immediate Availability**: Ready to use out of the box upon installing **[SYN-OS](https://github.com/syn990/SYN-OS)**.

-   **Seamless Performance**: Optimised to work with **[SYN-OS](https://github.com/syn990/SYN-OS)**'s core components for maximum efficiency.

-   **Unified Design**: Fully aligned with **[SYN-OS](https://github.com/syn990/SYN-OS)**'s aesthetic and functional principles.

* * * * *

How It Works
------------

SYNTERNAL combines an intelligent decision-making core (powered by Synternal Core) with a conversational front-end.

1.  **Input**: Users issue commands or ask questions in plain English.

2.  **Interpretation**: The core processes the input, determines intent, and maps it to system commands.

3.  **Execution**: Commands are executed on the host system, with outputs dynamically fetched and formatted for readability.

Examples:

-   **Input**: "What is my disk usage?"

    -   **Output**: Fetches and displays live disk usage.

-   **Input**: "Show running processes."

    -   **Output**: Executes `htop` or equivalent command and displays results.

* * * * *

Usage
-----

Once running **[SYN-OS](https://github.com/syn990/SYN-OS)**, you can interact with SYNTERNAL by typing commands such as:

-   **"What is my IP address?"**

-   **"Show my CPU temperature."**

-   **"Find files larger than 1GB in /home."**

-   **"Monitor system logs in real time."**

SYNTERNAL intelligently determines the appropriate system actions, executes them, and returns results in a user-friendly format.

* * * * *

Customisation
-------------

SYNTERNAL is fully customisable:

-   **Add Custom Commands**:\
    Extend functionality by editing the `custom_commands.py` file.

-   **Modify Configurations**:\
    Adjust settings in `config.json` to match your environment and preferences.

-   **Themes**:\
    Update the appearance of SYNTERNAL's output via the `themes` directory.

* * * * *

-------------------

-   **Operating System**: **[SYN-OS](https://github.com/syn990/SYN-OS)**.

-   **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher.

-   **Memory**: 2--4 GB of RAM (optimised for low-resource machines).

-   **Dependencies**: Prebuilt and preconfigured as part of **[SYN-OS](https://github.com/syn990/SYN-OS)**.

* * * * *

Development Status
